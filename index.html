                    <h2>Meet Cosmo:</h2>
                    <p>
                        Cosmo is the sweetest dog you’ll find around town.  Born in Arizona, Cosmo moved to Redwood City 3 years into his life with his owner, Alex.  Cosmo’s been hopping around the bay area, most recently spending two years in San Francisco.  He know resides in Emerald Hills, where he spends his days sun tanning, eating snacks, and playing with his best friend, Honeybun.  Check out Cosmo’s list to learn more about him.

                    <h2>What breed is Cosmo?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Cosmo is a Maltese-Havanese mix, as far as we know.  He was adopted off craigslist so we can never be too sure.  Maltese-Havenese mixed dogs share traits like being energetic, loveable, smart, and stubborn.  I can promise Cosmo will always understand you, but I can’t promise he’ll listen to you.  Take a look at Cosmo’s gallery and let us know if you think he looks more Maltese or Havenese

                        Cosmo has a huge family that he loves to spend time with.  He lives with his mom (Alex), his grandma (meemaw), his grandpa, and his mom’s sister Sophie. Stephanie, his mom’s other sister, also loves to spend time with Cosmo when she’s visiting from New York.  Cosmo also has three cat cousins, named Honeybun, Prince, and Penelope.
